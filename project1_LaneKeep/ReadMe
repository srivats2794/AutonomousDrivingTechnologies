The lane keep project involved implementing a pure pursuit controller on a 1/10th scale vehicle that goes around a track.
This vehicle had a camera mounted on it (camera calibration was done by me) and it had to navigate through the track by detecting
the lanes. Further the lane prediction based on computer vision was updated using Kalman filter. 
The project was implemented using Matlab on a host computer and arduino as a micro controller.
